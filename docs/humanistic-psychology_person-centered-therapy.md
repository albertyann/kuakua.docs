# **Person-centered therapy**

Person-centered therapy, also referred to as Rogerian therapy, is a client-centered approach that empowers individuals to take charge of their mental well-being. This therapeutic method shifts the focus from the mental health professional to the client, allowing them to control the therapeutic process. It creates a secure environment where clients can enhance self-awareness and discover their own solutions. Person-centered therapy is beneficial for addressing a wide range of mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and others.

## Client vs. Patient

In this type of therapy, the term "client" is intentionally chosen to avoid suggesting that the individual seeking therapy is ill. Using "client" instead empowers the person seeking help by emphasizing their control over their life and future, highlighting their capability to overcome any challenges they encounter.

## How it works

In person-centered therapy, the client and therapist collaborate as a team. The therapist offers support without judgment, refraining from giving advice or solutions to the client's issues. Person-centered therapy is a non-directive approach focused on empathy, aiming to provide individuals with a secure environment to express themselves, achieve self-actualization (realizing their full potential), and initiate positive changes in their lives.

Person-centered therapy is beneficial for addressing various forms of mental distress, including:

  * Anxiety
  * Psychosis
  * Dementia
  * Depression
  * Post-traumatic stress disorder
  * Other mood disorders



## Involved techniques

There are three primary techniques employed in person-centered therapy, each intended to facilitate individuals in gaining awareness of their behaviors within a secure environment. This awareness enables people to subsequently make the essential changes required for recovery.

### Genuineness and Congruence

The genuineness and congruence technique in person-centered therapy entails the therapist being authentic and aligned with their clients. The therapist openly shares their thoughts and feelings, encouraging clients to do the same. This approach fosters self-awareness, helping clients understand how their thoughts and emotions impact their experiences.

Clients feel more secure when their therapist demonstrates authenticity, which cultivates trust and strengthens the therapeutic relationship. This trust enables clients to feel at ease and authentically express themselves during therapy sessions.

### Unconditional Positive Regard

Unconditional positive regard in client-centered therapy signifies complete acceptance. It means the therapist consistently supports and accepts their client without judgment.

The therapist respects and validates all of their client's emotions, demonstrating active listening and positive body language to provide reassurance. This approach fosters a safe environment where clients feel genuinely understood and accepted during therapy sessions.

### Empathetic Understanding

Empathy is the genuine understanding and mutual sharing of feelings between two individuals. In person-centered therapy, empathy is utilized by the therapist to deeply comprehend who you are, how your life experiences shape you, and your perspective on the world, yourself, and your relationships.

The primary objective of empathetic understanding is to ensure that clients feel completely heard and comprehended in every aspect of their communication. This approach provides clients with the opportunity to gain new insights into themselves that may not have been accessible before starting therapy.
