Uncovering your life's purpose can be a challenging quest, yet it's essential for living with greater significance. Often, this quest involves identifying where your talents meet your passions. This is precisely the essence of the concept of ikigai.

## What is, and What is Not Ikigai

**ikigai** (生き甲斐), pronounced "ee-kee-guy," is a term from Japanese culture that intertwines the essence of living with a driving purpose. It is derived from 'iki,' meaning life, and 'gai,' meaning value or reason, thus creating the notion of "a reason for living."

This idea has its origins in traditional Chinese philosophy, particularly Daoism and Confucianism, which have significantly influenced Japanese thought. By understanding the underlying principles of these philosophies, people can better appreciate ikigai and apply it to their own lives for enhanced well-being and fulfillment.

According to the Japanese, the answer to a meaningful and purposeful life can be attained by discovering one’s "ikigai."  
The simply means, "reason for being," or "reason to live."  
Ikigai can be broken down into two components: "iki" (生き) meaning "life" and "gai" (甲斐) meaning "worth" or "value."  
Thus, ikigai translates to "the worth of living" or "the joy and purpose of life."  
It is a philosophy that encourages individuals to find their passion, pursue it with dedication, and contribute to the greater good.  
Associated with passion, it implies that pursuing it requires a significant amount of effort and determination.

Although there isn't an exact English equivalent for ikigai, it uniquely captures the pursuit of happiness through a life lived with a clear sense of purpose. Ikigai is not a logical or philosophical concept; it is an experiential, everyday phenomenon that relates to a reason for your being. It cannot be understood without lived experience. It is a feeling that arises in your body when you are living your mission (Kamiya, 1966).

Thus, a literal translation may not fully convey the depth and significance of the term. As a result, numerous translations have been proposed, all of which are considered to be accurate:

  * reason to live
  * the purpose of life
  * reason for being
  * the meaning of life
  * reason to get up in the morning or jump out of bed
  * what makes life worth living
  * the thing that you live for
  * happiness of being
  * a raison d’etre
  * Reason for existence
  * and so on…



### The Four Elements of Ikigai

![The Four Elements of Ikigai](https://i.ibb.co/BLGqhc5/ikigai2.png)

  1. **What You Love (Passion):** Identifying activities that bring joy and fulfillment.
  2. **What You Are Good At (Profession):** Recognizing and honing your skills and talents.
  3. **What the World Needs (Mission):** Contributing to the well-being of others and making a positive impact.
  4. **What You Can Be Paid For (Vocation):** Finding a sustainable way to support yourself financially while pursuing your passions.



## The Roots of Ikigai

### Daoism and the Concept of Harmony

Daoism, founded by Laozi, emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao (the Way), a fundamental principle that guides all things in the universe. A famous Daoist saying, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step" (千里之行始于足下), encapsulates the idea of starting small and taking consistent actions to achieve great things. This approach aligns with the concept of ikigai, where small daily actions contribute to a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment.

### Confucianism and Ethical Living

Confucianism, established by Confucius, stresses the importance of ethical behavior, self-cultivation, and social harmony. Confucius taught that virtues like benevolence (仁), righteousness (义), and propriety (礼) should be actively practiced. Wang Yangming, a later Confucian philosopher, introduced the idea of "Unity of Knowledge and Action" (知行合一), which asserts that true knowledge is reflected in ethical actions. This principle resonates with ikigai, where one's purpose is realized through consistent, meaningful actions.

## The Benefits of Finding Your Ikigai

Embracing the fundamental tenets of ikigai is an ongoing journey of introspection and personal development, offering a multitude of advantages:

  * **Better Health:** Research indicates that having a life purpose and meaning, which are important components of ikigai, can positively affect health. It may contribute to a stronger immune system (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2011), better subjective health, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL; Park et al., 2008).
  * **Reduced Stress:** A sense of meaning and purpose in life can reduce an individual's allostatic load (Kotera et al., 2021). Allostatic load is the physiological burden experienced by the body in response to external challenges (i.e., stress), which has been positively associated with a greater risk of illness, cognitive decline, and mortality (Zilioli et al., 2015).
  * **Boosted Motivation:** One mechanism for the relationship between ikigai and health outcomes might be that ikigai is associated with more health-promoting behaviors (i.e., exercising, refraining from smoking) and stronger beliefs that one has control over one’s health (Kang et al., 2019). Ikigai provides balance and guidance, especially during challenging times. It serves as a motivational force that helps individuals navigate difficulties and maintain a positive outlook. By connecting with like-minded people, individuals can build supportive communities that offer encouragement and a sense of belonging.
  * **Profound Fulfillment:** Engaging in activities you love and making a positive impact on the world can lead to deep feelings of fulfillment, enhancing your quality of life. Pursuing ikigai can significantly enhance overall well-being and happiness. When individuals have a clear sense of purpose, they experience direction, fulfillment, and joy in their daily lives. Engaging in activities they love reduces stress and promotes mental and emotional stability.
  * **Personal Development:** The pursuit and realization of your ikigai is a path of self-enrichment. It involves exploring new dimensions of your interests, refining your skills, and broadening your worldview.

## How to Ikigai

Ikigai is more than just a philosophy; it is a way of life that encourages individuals to live with purpose, passion, and joy.

Finding ikigai involves exploring passions, values, strengths, and skills. It is a journey of self-discovery, characterized by fluidity and change, requiring patience and openness to new experiences.

By understanding and embracing ikigai, you can embark on a journey toward a more meaningful and fulfilling life. Start small, stay committed, and let your passions guide you towards your purpose.

Imagine waking up with passion for what is to become. It is an awesome feeling, especially on those Monday mornings. How great would it be to know that the day ahead of you will be a day for you? Act on your passions daily, and you will surely be excited to continue, again and again, the next day and the day after. Have ikigai and you will find yourself saying, "Today was a great day. I lived today."

Life is not always about ice cream, glitter, and rainbows. Just like everyone else, we all face difficulties and struggles. We experience loss and failure, like falling off the proverbial bicycle and skinning our knees. Circumstances out of our control constantly throw life’s curveballs at us, and we get knocked down.

Ikigai does not eliminate these things from your life. However, it is at those times when you need your purpose in life the most. Ikigai will help you pick yourself up through tough times as it provides you with the balance you need in your life. Ikigai is as much of a guiding light in times of difficulty, pain, and sorrow as it is a reason for waking up. Being engaged in your purpose helps you through the process. It helps you cope with difficult emotions.

Here is an inspiring TED talk by Tim Tamashiro on "How to Ikigai":

## Is Ikigai Spiritual?

## Does Everyone Have Ikigai?

Ikigai is inherent in all individuals, shaped by personal values and beliefs. It is a unique journey of self-discovery, emphasizing the importance of continuous growth and alignment with one's passions and purpose.

## Is ikigai the secret to longevity?​

It’s believed that ikigai can bring not just happiness but also longevity – the chance to live a longer life.

Naturally, there are no guarantees that one shall surpass the lifespan of venerable individuals such as Grandma Moses.

But the people of Okinawa, Japan, seem to believe that having a strong sense of purpose in life is crucial to living a long and prosperous one.

Having one of the world’s highest populations of centenarians, Okinawans are living proof.

Okinawa is a ‘Blue Zone,’ one of a few places on earth with above-average longevity rates. It "has the oldest living female population in the world," as Dan Buettner, a writer for National Geographic shares in his TED Talk, How to Live to Be 100+.

Buettner explains that while diet and society are essential factors contributing to the health and well-being of Okinawans, there’s something more to it.

There’s an elusive element, an inner drive, a profound sense of purpose that we call ikigai.

## Writing at the End

Ikigai is simple and can be found everywhere in life. It can mean enjoying a cup of your favorite coffee, listening to your favorite music, or anything else that brings joy. Without these moments in life, our levels of happiness and health may decrease (Mogi, 2017). Find your ikigai, and you will find your life. As Hector Garcia Puigcerver once said, "Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you."
