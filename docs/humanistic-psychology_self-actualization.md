# **Self-Actualization**

Self-actualization is the thorough realization of one's potential and the complete development of one's abilities, along with a deep appreciation for life.

## Key figure

###  _Kurt Goldstein_

While the term "self-actualization" is commonly associated with Abraham Maslow, it was originally introduced by Kurt Goldstein, a physician specializing in psychiatry and neuroanatomy in the early 20th century.

Goldstein regarded self-actualization as the ultimate goal of every organism, describing it as the innate drive for self-fulfillment and the natural tendency of individuals to realize their potential. He argued that every human being, plant, and animal inherently strives to actualize itself as it is. Goldstein emphasized that organisms behave in alignment with this fundamental motivation.

According to Goldstein's perspective, self-actualization was not merely a future goal to achieve, but rather an innate propensity of an organism to realize its potential at any given moment, depending on the circumstances.

### _Carl Rogers_

Carl Rogers described self-actualization as an ongoing, lifelong process where an individual maintains and enhances their self-concept through reflection and reinterpretation of experiences, facilitating personal recovery, change, and growth.According to Rogers (1967), the human organism possesses an innate "actualizing tendency" that strives to develop all capacities in ways that foster autonomy and enhance the individual.

Rogers posited that self-actualization depends on positive self-regard, which individuals achieve through unconditional positive regard from others, especially from caregivers during childhood. This support fosters feelings of being valued and respected without conditions.

For self-actualization to occur, there must be congruence between an individual's self-image and their ideal self-how they aspire to be or believe they should be. A significant disparity between these concepts leads to negative feelings of self-worth, hindering the process of self-actualization.

Rogers proposes that the self is a consistent yet fluid pattern of self-perceptions shaped through evaluative interactions.However, the discrepancy between one's ideal self and actual experiences (or self-image) can lead to incongruence, a state of psychological discord rooted in deviations from one's innate actualizing tendency.

According to Rogers, individuals who are actively self-actualizing explore their potentials and abilities, experiencing alignment between their real and ideal selves, thus achieving full functioning. Becoming a fully functioning person entails embracing one's authentic self, accepting who they are without pretense or deception. It involves moving away from the insecurity of trying to be more than one is or the guilt of trying to be less.

Such individuals increasingly listen to their deepest emotional and psychological impulses, becoming more willing to authentically express their true selves with greater depth and accuracy. Fully functioning people are attuned to their emotions and capabilities, trusting their innermost instincts and intuitions.

To achieve full functioning, individuals require unconditional positive regard from others, particularly during childhood from significant figures like parents. Unconditional positive regard involves accepting others despite their imperfections.

However, many people perceive regard from others as conditional, believing they are loved and valued only when they meet specific conditions of worth. These conditions of worth contribute to inner conflict within the self, creating a gap between the real self (how a person truly is) and the ideal self (how they believe they should be or aspire to be).

### _Abraham Maslow_

The contemporary understanding of self-actualization leans more towards Maslow's viewpoint than towards the perspectives of Goldstein or Rogers.

According to Maslow, the drive for self-actualization typically does not emerge until more basic needs are fulfilled. Self-actualized individuals accept themselves, faults and all, and are driven to express creativity in various aspects of their lives. While they come from diverse backgrounds and occupations, self-actualizers share common traits such as the ability to foster deep and loving relationships with others.

Like Goldstein, Maslow saw self-actualization as the realization of one's potential. However, Maslow defined self-actualization more narrowly than Goldstein by focusing exclusively on human beings, rather than all organisms. Maslow emphasized that humans have lower-order needs that must generally be fulfilled before higher-order needs, such as self-actualization, can be met. He categorized these needs as follows:

  1. Physiological needs

  2. Safety needs

  3. Belongingness needs

  4. Esteem needs

  5. Self-actualization needs




Self-actualization represents the pinnacle of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, meaning not every individual attains this stage.

### Takeaways

Kurt Goldstein emphasized the holistic nature of self-actualization, which includes physical, psychological, and social well-being. Maslow, on the other hand, structured a hierarchy of needs placing self-actualization at its peak, while Rogers emphasized the role of congruence and unconditional positive regard in nurturing personal growth.
