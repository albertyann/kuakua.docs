# üß† Psychological Cognitive Biases & Principles That Affect Your UX

With every new technological advancement, new constraints and possibilities are introduced.  
This article is a collection of best practices that designers can consider when building user interfaces.  
Sharing meaningful experiences will provide more support for psychological knowledge and contribute to making the world a better place.  
An understanding of psychology-specifically the psychology behind how users behave and interact with digital interfaces-is perhaps the single most valuable non-design skill a designer can have.  
Every time users interact with your product, they are:

  * üôà [Filter the information](/docs/product-psychology/the-psychology-of-design/information)
  * üîÆ [Seek the meaning of it](/docs/product-psychology/the-psychology-of-design/meaning)
  * ‚è∞ [Act within a given time](/docs/product-psychology/the-psychology-of-design/time)
  * üíæ [Store bits of the interaction in their memories](/docs/product-psychology/the-psychology-of-design/memory)



So to improve your user experience, you need to understand the biases & heuristics affecting those four decision-cycle steps.  
Below is a list of cognitive biases and design principles (with examples and tips) for each category. Let‚Äôs dive right in.
