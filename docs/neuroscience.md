# Neuroscience

Neuroscience refers to the scientific study of the nervous system-the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system-and its malfunctions.

It is a multidisciplinary science, combining physiology, anatomy, molecular biology, developmental biology, cytology, psychology, physics, computer science, chemistry, medicine, statistics, and mathematical modeling in understanding the fundamental and emergent properties of neurons, glia, and neural circuits.

The explanation of the biological mechanism of learning, memory, behavior, perception, and consciousness has been viewed by Eric Kandel as the "epic challenge" of the biological sciences.
