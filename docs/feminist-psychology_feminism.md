# **Feminism is it ? **

## 1\. What is Feminism?

Feminism encompasses a range of socio-political movements and ideologies aimed at defining and establishing gender equality in political, economic, personal, and social spheres. Feminism posits that modern societies are patriarchal, prioritizing the male perspective and unjustly treating women. Efforts to change this include challenging gender stereotypes and enhancing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women.

## 2\. The History of Feminism: Four Waves of Feminism

### First-wave feminism (19th to early 20th centuries)

First-wave feminism focused on equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women, leading to suffrage movements in countries like New Zealand and the UK by the late 19th century.

#### United Kingdom

In the UK, the suffragette movement led by Emmeline Pankhurst and the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) fought fiercely for women's right to vote. The Representation of the People Act 1918 granted voting rights to women over 30 who met minimum property requirements, and full equal suffrage was achieved in 1928.

#### France

French women were actively involved in feminist movements, with notable figures like Olympe de Gouges advocating for women's rights during the French Revolution. However, it was not until after World War II that French women gained the right to vote in 1944.

#### Germany

In Germany, women's suffrage was granted in 1918 following the end of World War I and the German Revolution. The Weimar Constitution recognized gender equality, but the rise of the Nazi regime reversed many gains until after World War II.

#### China

China's feminist movement began in the late Qing Dynasty, influenced by Western ideas. The May Fourth Movement in 1919 emphasized gender equality, and the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 enshrined women's rights in law.

In Pre-1949,the early women's movement in China focused on eradicating the assumption that women were inferior to men. The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the party issued a statement arguing for the end of Chinese traditions that repress women. They also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.

When the CCP entered the First United Front to fight warlords and unite China from 1924 to 1927 with the Kuomintang (KMT), each party established their own women's department during this time. However, the United Front ended with the Shanghai massacre in 1927, where the KMT launched an attack to purge communists and laborers. The ideas about liberating Chinese women from Confucian values were only permitted within the territory under CCP rule. These territories were called soviets, and were the places the CCP fled to following the White Terror because they were not under the control of the KMT. The KMT championed traditional Confucian ideals about women, and they established the New Life Movement, which sought to counter the gender role espoused by the CCP with traditional Confucian gender roles supported by the KMT. The CCP's time in the soviets from 1927 to 1945 also gave them the opportunity to develop the skills for organizing federations and governing, which greatly facilitated the founding of the ACWF later.[4]

The Chinese women's movement gained a new momentum with The War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937–1945). Leaders of the women's movement expressed nationalist sentiments in response to the threat the war posed to their daily lives. These leaders called for the liberation of women to defend the nation. The number of official women's organization within the CCP at one of the soviets, Yan’an, grew during the invasion. In March 1938, at the First Women's Congress held by the Women's Federation of Shaan-Gan-Ning (a forerunner to the ACWF) in a different communist-controlled area, the leaders of the women's movement began to form their nationalist ideas into an agenda. The women in attendance stated that the goal of the women's movement should be to unite women and to work together to liberate China. The First Women's Congress also outlined goals for the women's movement such as: helping women escape abusive marriages, improving women's health, eradicating the practice of foot binding, ending domestic abuse, and protecting women's inheritance rights.[4] The ACWF would adopt many of the same goals in 1949.[3]

The All-China Democratic Women's Federation (ACWF) was established on 24 March 1949 as China's first country-wide women's organization, It was originally called the All-China Democratic Women's Foundation, and would be renamed the All-China Women's Federation on 3 April 1949.  
The organization began as a federation of various regional women's groups with the dual goals of building a socialist China and promoting the status of women.  
It is responsible for promoting government policies on women, and protecting women's rights within the government, while liberating them from traditional norms within society and involving them in social revolution with the aim to promote their overall status and welfare in Chinese society.

#### Middle East

In the Middle East, women's rights movements have faced significant challenges. Turkey granted women the right to vote in 1934 under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's reforms. In other countries, progress has been slower and continues to face cultural and religious obstacles.

#### Africa

African women's movements have been diverse and multifaceted, addressing issues from colonialism to modern-day gender inequality. South African women, for instance, played a crucial role in the anti-apartheid movement and have continued to advocate for gender equality.

#### USA

At USA(1848 - 1920), The first organized movement aimed at gaining rights for American women effectively began in July 1848, with the convention organized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott at Seneca Falls, New York. Attendees signed the Declaration of Sentiments, which affirmed women’s equality with men, and passed a dozen resolutions calling for various specific rights, including the right to vote.  
Although the early women’s rights movement was linked to abolitionism, passage of the 15th Amendment in 1870 angered some women’s rights leaders who resented Black men being granted suffrage before white women. Similarly, the women’s suffrage movement also largely marginalized or excluded Black feminists like Sojourner Truth and Ida B. Wells. Though ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920 fulfilled the principal goal of feminism’s first wave—guaranteeing white women the right to vote—Black women and other women of color faced continued obstacles until passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

### Second-wave Feminism (Mid-20th century)

Second-wave feminism aimed to address broader gender inequalities, emphasizing the personal as political.

#### United Kingdom

The 1960s and 70s saw a resurgence of feminism in the UK, with the establishment of the Women's Liberation Movement. Key events included the 1970 Miss World protest and the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act.

#### France

French feminism in the second wave was marked by influential works like Simone de Beauvoir's _The Second Sex_ and the activism of groups such as Mouvement de Libération des Femmes (MLF). The 1970s saw significant advancements in reproductive rights and workplace equality.

#### Germany

In Germany, the second wave focused on reproductive rights, anti-discrimination laws, and gender roles. The feminist movement gained momentum with the founding of groups like Aktion 218, which campaigned for abortion rights.

#### China

The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) in China had complex effects on gender equality. While it promoted women's participation in the workforce, it also enforced strict gender roles. Post-Mao reforms in the 1980s began addressing these issues more directly.

#### Middle East

In Iran, the 1979 revolution initially set back women's rights, but feminist movements have continued to push for reforms. In other parts of the Middle East, the second wave brought gradual changes, often met with significant resistance.

#### Africa

African feminism during the second wave often intersected with anti-colonial and anti-apartheid struggles. Women's roles in liberation movements were crucial, and post-independence, many continued to fight for gender equality.

#### USA

At USA(1963 - 1980s), In 1963, Betty Friedan published _The Feminine Mystique_ , which argued that women were chafing against the confines of their roles as wives and mothers. The book was a massive success, selling 3 million copies in three years and launching what became known as the second wave of feminism. Inspired by the civil rights movement and protests against the Vietnam War, second-wave feminists called for a reevaluation of traditional gender roles in society and an end to sexist discrimination.  
Feminism—or "women’s liberation"—gained strength as a political force in the 1970s, as Friedan, Gloria Steinem, and Bella Abzug founded the National Women’s Political Caucus in 1971. High points of the second wave included passage of the Equal Pay Act and the landmark Supreme Court decisions in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) and Roe v. Wade (1973) related to reproductive freedom. But while Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972, a conservative backlash ensured it fell short of the number of states needed for ratification.  
Like the suffrage movement, second-wave feminism drew criticism for centering privileged white women, and some Black women formed their own feminist organizations, including the National Black Feminist Organization (NBFO). Despite its achievements, the women’s liberation movement had begun to lose momentum by 1980, when conservative forces swept Ronald Reagan to the White House.

### Third-wave Feminism (Late 20th and early 21st centuries)

Third-wave feminism challenged essentialist views of femininity and integrated intersectional perspectives.

#### United Kingdom

The third wave in the UK saw a focus on intersectionality, with increased attention to issues affecting women of different races, classes, and sexual orientations. The movement also embraced popular culture and media to spread its message.

#### France

French third-wave feminism emphasized sexual freedom, body autonomy, and intersectionality. Influential voices included writers and activists like Elisabeth Badinter and the emergence of feminist blogs and online communities.

#### Germany

In Germany, the third wave tackled issues like sexual harassment, reproductive rights, and the gender pay gap. The movement also became more inclusive of LGBTQ+ rights and intersectional concerns.

#### China

China's third wave began addressing more diverse issues, including LGBTQ+ rights, domestic violence, and workplace discrimination. The rise of the internet allowed feminist voices to reach a broader audience.

#### Middle East

The third wave in the Middle East focused on challenging patriarchal norms and advocating for legal reforms. Activists used social media to organize and spread awareness, often facing severe repercussions.

#### Africa

African third-wave feminism continued to address issues like gender-based violence, economic inequality, and political representation. The movement became more inclusive, recognizing the diverse experiences of women across the continent.

#### USA

At USA(1990s), While the advances of second-wave feminism had undoubtedly achieved more equality and rights for women, the movement that emerged in the early 1990s focused on tackling problems that still existed, including sexual harassment in the workplace and a shortage of women in positions of power. Rebecca Walker, the mixed-race daughter of second-wave leader Alice Walker, announced the arrival of feminism’s "third wave" in 1992, while watching Anita Hill testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her accusations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. That same year, dubbed the "Year of the Woman," saw an unprecedented number of women elected to Congress.  
Embracing the spirit of rebellion instead of reform, third-wave feminists encouraged women to express their sexuality and individuality. Many embraced a more traditionally feminine style of dress and grooming, and even rejected the term "feminist" as a way of distancing themselves from their second-wave predecessors. "Riot grrl" groups like Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, and Heavens to Betsy brought their brand of feminism into pop music, including songs that addressed issues of sexism, patriarchy, abuse, racism, and rape.  
Third wave feminism also sought to be more inclusive when it came to race and gender. The work of scholar and theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw on the concept of "intersectionality," or how types of oppression (based on race, class, gender, etc.) can overlap, was particularly influential in this area. Third-wave feminists also drew on the work of gender theorist Judith Butler, including support for trans rights in this type of intersectional feminism.

### Fourth-wave Feminism (starting around 2012)

Fourth-wave feminism leverages social media to combat sexual harassment and violence against women, highlighted by movements like #MeToo and campaigns such as the Women's Marches. These waves reflect the evolving global discourse on feminism, from political rights to cultural identities.

#### United Kingdom

Fourth-wave feminism in the UK has been driven by campaigns against sexual harassment, such as #MeToo and #TimesUp. Activists have also focused on issues like period poverty, reproductive rights, and trans inclusivity.

#### France

In France, the fourth wave has seen movements like #BalanceTonPorc (the French equivalent of #MeToo) gaining momentum. Feminists continue to challenge sexual harassment, domestic violence, and systemic inequality.

#### Germany

German fourth-wave feminism addresses digital activism, gender-based violence, and workplace equality. The movement also focuses on dismantling systemic racism and supporting refugee and immigrant women.

#### China

The internet has been a crucial tool for fourth-wave feminism in China, with social media campaigns highlighting issues like sexual harassment and gender discrimination. Despite censorship, activists continue to push for change.

#### Middle East

In the Middle East, fourth-wave feminism is leveraging social media to address issues such as gender-based violence, legal inequalities, and cultural norms. Activists face significant risks but continue to advocate for women's rights.

#### Africa

Fourth-wave feminism in Africa uses digital platforms to address gender-based violence, economic empowerment, and political representation. Movements like #TotalShutdown in South Africa highlight the ongoing struggle for gender equality.

#### Australia

In Australia, the fourth wave has focused on addressing issues like workplace harassment, gender pay gaps, and reproductive rights. Activists have used social media to organize and advocate for policy changes.

#### USA

At USA(Present Day), Though fourth wave feminism is relatively difficult to define—as some people argue it’s simply a continuation of the third wave—the emergence of the Internet has certainly led to a new brand of social media-fueled activism. Launched by Tarana Burke in 2007, the #MeToo movement took off in 2017 in the wake of revelations about the sexual misconduct of influential film producer Harvey Weinstein.  
In addition to holding powerful men accountable for their actions, fourth-wave feminists are turning their attention to the systems that allow such misconduct to occur. Like their predecessors in the feminist cause, they also continue to grapple with the concept of intersectionality, and how the movement can be inclusive and representative regardless of sexuality, race, class, and gender.
