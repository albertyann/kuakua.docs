# **What is Family Psychology**

## Family Psychology Overview

Family psychology is a discipline focused on studying various psychological phenomena within family systems. It examines interactions, emotional connections, power struggles, and communication patterns among family members, aiming to enhance their psychological well-being and improve family relationships. Family psychology views the family as a cohesive system, emphasizing mutual dependencies and interactions among its members. It explores how family structure influences individual psychological development and how family dynamics change over the lifespan. Family psychology covers a wide range of topics, including:

  * **Family System**
  * **Family Therapy**
  * **Family Functioning**
  * **[Parenting Styles](/docs/family-psychology/parenting-styles)**
  * **Attachment Styles**



## [family of origin](/docs/family-psychology/understanding-family-of-origin)

**[family of origin](/docs/family-psychology/understanding-family-of-origin)** refers to the early social group to which an individual belonged during childhood, typically referring to one's biological or adoptive family. The family of origin is often contrasted with families formed through adult choices such as marriage and independent living. Throughout the prolonged process of growth, individuals form fixed thought patterns and attachment styles. The process of growth is also one of continual recognition, perception, and reflection upon the [family of origin](/docs/family-psychology/understanding-family-of-origin).

Parents shape a child's core beliefs about themselves, influencing beliefs about the significance of family and life goals, which profoundly affect learning and development. These beliefs, in turn, influence every decision and choice a child makes, as well as every relationship they enter. Since the quality of family life is created by parents, if one or both parents are immature, they will struggle to create a healthy family environment. Depending on the degree of immaturity, the family environment can range from mildly unhealthy to severely unhealthy. Children raised in an unhealthy environment inevitably perceive themselves and the world around them in distorted ways.

## Family Systems

**Family systems** is a concept first introduced in experiential family therapy. The family is seen as a stable system where interactions among members create tangible and intangible rules, forming a relatively stable family structure with specific interaction patterns among members. At the same time, the family system is an open system, continuously interacting with external systems, with ongoing interactions among internal members and subsystems. Primary subsystems within the family include parent-parent, parent-child, and sibling relationships. The most enduring subsystems are spousal, parental, and sibling relationships, with the marital subsystem serving as the foundation directly influencing the overall functional structure of the family.

  * **Spousal Subsystem** : Once a family is formed, the spousal subsystem emerges. Its primary tasks are complementarity and mutual adaptation, providing mutual support and a sense of security, fostering interdependence.
  * **Parental Subsystem** : The parental subsystem emerges after the birth of the first child. It must set boundaries that allow children to approach parents while not disrupting the functioning of the spousal subsystem. As children grow, the parental subsystem faces various challenges requiring adjustments to cope with these changes.
  * **Parent-Child Subsystem** : The parent-child subsystem forms after the birth of the first child. This subsystem faces numerous developmental tasks such as nurturing and educating children, managing interactions between children and parents, teaching obedience to authority while fostering their ability to make independent decisions and advocate for their own interests.
  * **Sibling Subsystem** : The sibling subsystem emerges when the second child is born. This is where children learn and practice peer relationships, learning to support, cooperate, protect, compete, and coordinate in their interactions.



## Family Systems Theory

**Family systems theory** , pioneered by medical doctor L. Murray Bowen (1913-1990), views the family as a system guided by the same scientific principles that govern all living organisms. The theory provides profound insights into the dynamics of family relationships and how they shape our lives. This influential theory explores the interactions between family systems, emotional fusion, and differentiation concepts. It includes eight core concepts:

  * **Triangles** : When tension arises between two individuals, a third person intervenes to alleviate conflict. Triangles can complicate relationships and perpetuate unhealthy dynamics.
  * **Differentiation of Self** : Families and other social groups significantly influence people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, but individuals vary in their sensitivity to "group think." Lower levels of differentiation of self increase susceptibility to group influences, leading individuals to either seek control or be controlled.
  * **Emotional Processes in the Nuclear Family** : Describes four basic relationship patterns that determine problematic areas within families. Driven by part of the emotional system, these patterns include marital conflict, spouse dysfunction, impairment of one or more children, and emotional distancing.
  * **Family Projection Process** : The primary way parents transmit emotional issues to children. Projection processes impair the functioning of one or more children and increase their susceptibility to clinical symptoms.
  * **Multigenerational Transmission Process** : Describes how subtle differences in differentiation levels between parents and children lead to significant differentiation differences among family members across generations. Transmission occurs through relationships over several generations, ranging from conscious teaching and learning to automatic and unconscious emotional responses and behaviors.
  * **Emotional Cutoff** : Describes how people manage unresolved emotional issues by reducing or completely severing emotional ties with family members.
  * **Sibling Position** : Based on psychologist Walter Toman's research, sibling position influences individual development and behavior. People in different positions share significant common characteristics; for example, firstborns tend to assume leadership roles, while laterborns often prefer follower roles.
  * **Social Emotional Process** : Describes how emotional systems control behavior across the entire society.



## Family Therapy

**Family therapy** (also known as family counseling, family systems therapy, marriage and family therapy) is a branch of psychotherapy that focuses on families and couples in intimate relationships to facilitate change and development. It tends to view change from the perspective of the interactional system among family members.

Family therapy schools believe that involving the family in problem-solving is often beneficial to the client, regardless of whether the root of the problem is considered "individual" or "family" by the visitor.

  1. **Structural Therapy** : Identifies and reorganizes the family system's organization to improve family functioning. It focuses on altering interaction patterns and power dynamics within the family.
  2. [**Strategic Therapy**](/docs/family-psychology/strategic-family-therapy): Examines interaction patterns between family members and designs specific strategies to disrupt negative interaction cycles, promoting positive change.
  3. **Systemic/Milan Therapy** : Focuses on the belief systems of family members and aims to enhance family health by modifying these beliefs. It emphasizes understanding how family members interpret and handle problems through their beliefs and perspectives.
  4. **Narrative Therapy** : Involves redefining the dominant problem-saturated narrative, focusing on context and separating the problem from the person. It assists family members in reconstructing their life stories in a more positive manner.
  5. **Transgenerational Therapy** : Analyzes and interrupts the transgenerational transmission of unhelpful belief and behavior patterns, helping family members understand and change negative influences passed down through generations.
  6. **IPscope Model and Interventive Interviewing** : Utilizes a systematic interview approach to assess family interactions and implement targeted interventions to enhance the family system.
  7. **Communication Theory** : Studies and applies principles of effective communication within the family to resolve conflicts and improve relationships.
  8. **Psychoeducation** : Provides family members with information and education about psychological issues, helping them understand and cope with their problems better.
  9. **Psychotherapy** : Utilizes various therapeutic techniques to address mental and emotional issues within the family, aiming to improve overall family dynamics and individual well-being.
  10. **Relationship Counseling** : Concentrates on improving relationships among family members through counseling techniques, addressing issues such as communication, conflict resolution, and emotional connection.
  11. **Relationship Education** : Offers training and education to family members to enhance their communication and relationship skills, promoting overall family well-being.
  12. **Systemic Coaching** : Applies systems theory to coach family members, assisting them in resolving issues and achieving goals within the family system.
  13. **Systems Theory** : Applies systems theory principles to understand and explain how the family functions as a whole system and how changes in one part of the system can affect the entire family.
  14. **Reality Therapy** : Emphasizes personal responsibility and dealing with reality, encouraging family members to make positive changes in their relationships and personal issues.
  15. **The Genogram** : A tool mapping out the family tree across three generations, helping family members understand and identify patterns and history within the family to better address current issues and relationships.



## Family Functioning

**Family functioning** is synonymous with the level of differentiation within the family system. According to Bowen (1978), effective or well-differentiated systems are characterized by their ability to balance ongoing tensions between separateness and connectedness. In these families, members demonstrate mutual respect and care. Children are encouraged to develop self-respect and interpersonal skills necessary for effectively managing common difficulties encountered in intimate relationships, modeled through interactions between parents and children. Parents exhibit empathy towards their children, and conflicts between parents and children (and between spouses) are handled constructively. Individuality and autonomy are fostered through respectful, warm, and caring connections demonstrated by parents towards each other and their children.

## [Parenting Styles](/docs/family-psychology/parenting-styles) (Positive Parenting Styles)

**Parenting styles** refer to the patterns of behaviors, attitudes, and approaches parents use when interacting with and raising their children. The study of parenting styles is based on the understanding that parents differ in their approaches to parenting, which significantly impact children's growth and happiness. Parenting styles differ from specific parenting behaviors as they represent broader patterns and attitudes that create an emotional atmosphere for children. Parenting styles also encompass how parents respond to and demand from their children. There are four main parenting styles: authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, and neglectful.

## Attachment Styles

**Attachment styles** were proposed by British psychologist John Bowlby and refer to how humans interact and bond with each other. This also affects how we perceive and interpret our relationships, ultimately influencing the dynamics of intimacy. Psychologist Mary Ainsworth greatly expanded on Bowlby's research in the 1970s, and other researchers have added to our understanding of attachment styles. Today, the four primary attachment styles are secure, anxious, avoidant, and disorganized, with the former three defined by Ainsworth and the latter added by researchers Main and Solomon in 1986.

## Parental Psychological Control

**Psychological control (PC)** is a parental behavior characterized by intrusive and manipulative actions targeting a child's or adolescent's thoughts and feelings to control their psychological world. These behaviors include inducing guilt, withdrawing affection, and/or manipulating the parent-child relationship across generations.
