# **Addiction**

## 1 Substance addiction

Substance addiction refers to excessive dependence and abuse of drugs, alcohol, or other chemicals. This addiction can lead to physical and psychological dependence, making it difficult for individuals to control their use and potentially affecting social functioning, work, and health.

### Alcoholism

Alcoholism is a type of alcohol abuse and is a very serious condition in which sufferers are unable to control the amount of alcohol they consume. By losing control of their alcohol habits, patients’ lives are affected in a negative manner. This can be in the form of losing their job, relationship problems, and financial issues amongst other things.

### Drug addictions

Drug addiction is the chronic inability to stop using drugs even if they are causing harm to oneself or others. One of the leading causes of death is overdose by prescription medication, which is caused by the build-up of tolerance from overuse.  
Cocaine Addiction:When someone uses cocaine, the drug sends signals to the brain to release dopamine – also known as ‘the feel-good hormone’ – but instead of being recycled back into the brain as is usually the case, cocaine prevents the reabsorption. This means that your brain is flooded with dopamine and you will feel an intense high.  
Opioid Addiction:Opioids are a class of drugs which include fentanyl, heroin and some legally prescribed pain relief drugs.As well as their pain relief properties, the drugs can also give a ‘high’, and with sustained use, you can become addicted to opioids like any other addictive substance.  
Crack Cocaine Addiction:Crack addiction in popular culture is seen as a slightly humorous affliction that promotes absurd and sometimes comical behaviour. It is a serious affliction that if not treated correctly and experientially can have fatal effects on the afflicted.  
Benzodiazepine Addiction:Benzodiazepines cause changes in the brain’s chemical make-up, increasing the amounts of natural ‘reward-based’ chemicals present in the brain such as dopamine and norepinephrine – both of which are highly active in the process of emotion regulation and homeostasis.  
Amphetamine Addiction:Amphetamine addiction is a serious medical illness that requires the appropriate treatment. Amphetamines are a class of synthesized drugs that are usually available by prescription to treat an array of illnesses.  
Crystal Meth Addiction:Taking crystal meth offers users an increased potential for physical and mental activity, decreases appetite and generates feelings of pleasure and euphoria.

## 2 Behavioral addiction

The term behavioral addiction refers to a compulsion to engage in a natural reward which is a behavior that is inherently rewarding (i.e., desirable or appealing) – despite adverse consequences.Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that marked increases in the expression of ΔFosB through repetitive and excessive exposure to a natural reward induces the same behavioral effects and neuroplasticity as occurs in a drug addiction.

### Gambling addiction

Gambling addiction is characterized by a strong urge to gamble uncontrollably. This addiction may manifest as increased frequency of gambling, raising stakes, and inability to stop gambling, potentially leading to financial, legal, and mental health issues.

### Sexual addiction

Sexual addiction is an excessive need for and inability to control sexual behaviors. This addiction may involve frequent sexual activity, risky sexual behaviors, sexual fantasies, and excessive reliance on pornography, negatively impacting interpersonal relationships, career, and mental health.

### Internet addiction disorder

Problematic internet use may include a preoccupation with the internet and/or digital media, excessive time spent using the internet despite resultant distress in the individual, increase in the amount of internet use required to achieve the same desired emotional response, loss of control over one's internet use habits, withdrawal symptoms, and continued problematic internet use despite negative consequences to one's work, social, academic, or personal life.

### Video game addiction

Video game addiction is characterized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as excessive gaming behavior, potentially prioritized over other interests, despite the negative consequences that may arise, for a period of at least 12 months

### Shopping addiction

### Body dysmorphic disorder

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a mental illness. People who have this illness constantly worry about the way they look. They may believe an inconspicuous or non-existent physical attribute is a serious defect. They respond to this by performing repetitive acts such as mirror checking or comparing their appearance with others.

### Internet porn addiction

Internet Porn Addiction is problematic for an individual due to personal or social reasons, including the excessive time spent viewing pornography instead of interacting with others and the facilitation of procrastination. Individuals may report depression, social isolation, career loss, decreased productivity, or financial consequences as a result of their excessive Internet pornography viewing impeding their social life

### Pornography addiction

Pornography addiction is the scientifically controversial application of an addiction model to the use of pornography. Pornography may be part of compulsive behavior with negative consequences to one's physical, mental, social, or financial well-being.

### Sports addiction

Sport addicts share many symptoms with other sorts of addicts. They harm their bodies: this is because they do not give them the chance of recovering from working out, often because of the intensity, duration and frequency of their training sessions. Sport becomes so much an obsession that such people don't take time to recover from injuries. Incidence of heart attacks and osteoporosis increase at high levels of exertion, so sports addicts can put themselves at serious risk of harm.

### Hoarding disorder

Hoarding disorder is a mental health condition in which you have a strong need to save a large number of items and experience distress when attempting to get rid of them. Hoarding disorder is treatable with cognitive behavioral therapy.  
Digital hoarding:Digital hoarding (also known as e-hoarding, e-clutter, data hoarding, digital pack-rattery or cyber hoarding) is defined by researchers as an emerging sub-type of hoarding disorder characterized by individuals collecting excessive digital material which leads to those individuals experiencing stress and disorganization.  
Animal hoarding:Animal hoarding, sometimes called Noah syndrome,is keeping a higher-than-usual number of animals as domestic pets without the ability to properly house or care for them, while at the same time denying this inability.  
Food Hoarding:You probably know that there are many types of people who tend to store up a little extra food in case of emergencies. However, people predisposed to hoarding can start having strong compulsions about keeping food. And it is worth noting that people who usually struggle with food hoarding typically have some past trauma associated with fears of not having enough food.  
Garbage or Trash Hoarding:A person can be identified as a garbage or trash hoarder when they display an inability to discard waste, garbage, or trash. Also, note that garbage hoarders frequently rummage through other people’s trash in order to find "treasures" of their own. As you can imagine, this inability to differentiate valuable items from harmful waste can be a cause of concern.  
Sentimental Hoarding:Sentimental hoarding is a type of hoarding where individuals have difficulty letting go of objects that hold emotional value to them, such as gifts, letters, and photographs. It's not just about having a lot of sentimental items, but the inability to part with them even if they are no longer needed or useful. This type of hoarding can cause clutter and can lead to living spaces becoming hazardous and uninhabitable.  
Media or Paper Hoarding:Media hoarding involves an excessive accumulation of newspapers, magazines, books, or other forms of paper. People who struggle with media hoarding may feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of paper they accumulate and may be unable to part with it due to the belief that it may be useful in the future. This can also lead to clutter and can cause fire hazards due to the volume of paper stored in one place.

### Love addiction

Love addiction creates fixations and compulsions in love interests and can play itself out in unhealthy behaviors toward loved ones.

### Relationship addiction

Relationship addiction is characterized by cravings and a loss of control when it comes to being in a relationship with a specific person. Like love addicts, people with relationship addiction seek feelings of euphoria and gain intense chemical reactions and releases while in pursuit of or in a relationship.

### technological dependence

Technological dependence refers to the reliance on technology to solve problems or complete everyday tasks.

### information overload

Information overload (also known as infobesity,infoxication,or information anxiety) is the difficulty in understanding an issue and effectively making decisions when one has too much information (TMI) about that issue,and is generally associated with the excessive quantity of daily information.

### Ruinophilia
