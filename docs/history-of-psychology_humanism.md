# HUMANISM

Humanistic Psychology is a psychological perspective that arose in the mid 20th century that derives from [Sigmund Freud](/docs/psychologists/Sigmund-Freud)'s psychoanalytic theory and B.F. Skinner's behaviorism. It emphasizes humans drive to be inherently good through self-actualization, which is the process of realizing a reaching ones mental full potential and creativity.

One of the main tenants of humanistic psychology is that since humans are innately good that the social and cultural problems we find ourselves in is nothing more than deriving from the human condition. This all come to fruition in about the 1950's but they didn't officially establish the American Association for Humanistic Psychology till 1961.

The three features are genuineness, empathy, and unconditional positive regard.  
He believed that therapists should accept their clients no matter what they have done or who they are.  
Rogers also believed that all people are more capable of dealing with their issues on their own.  
Rogers has influenced how therapists interact with their clients greatly.

## Abraham Maslow & Hierarchy of Needs

![Abraham Maslow](/docs/Abraham-Maslow.avif)  
Abraham Maslow is one of the main proponents of the humanistic perspective of psychology and created the hierarchy of needs. He theorized that in order to achieve higher orders of function such as the forming of relationships and the building of esteem, other, more basic, needs must first be met. The first of these needs are physiological, food, water, sleep and sex, the second set of needs are shelter and safety, the third are social needs, being belonging, relationships and love, the next is esteem and ego. The fifth and final part of the pyramid is self-actualization, at this stage, one realizes their potential and seeks fulfillment and growth.

Another part of this theory states that the longer a need goes unmet, the more the need intensifies, hunger increases with time, being rejected by others constantly would become more and more disheartening and tiring. If a need becomes too frustrating, one may digress to a lower level with seemingly easier to meet goals. This is known as the "frustration-regression" theory.

Eight level models were introduced in the 1960s and 70s, the added levels included cognitive needs, such as searching for more knowledge and wisdom, as the fifth level rather, aesthetics, the appreciation of beauty, balance and symmetry as the sixth level, self-actualization was seventh and the last level was made transcendence needs, the wanting to help others achieve self-actualization.
