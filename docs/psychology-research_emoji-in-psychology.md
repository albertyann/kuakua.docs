# Emojis in Psychology: Their Role in Emotional Expression and Psychological Impact

## Introduction

Emojis, pictographs representing a wide range of facial expressions, symbols, and objects, have become ubiquitous in digital communication. Administered by the Unicode Consortium, emojis are now a staple in text messages, social media posts, and other online forums worldwide. Emerging studies suggest that emojis contribute significantly to the emotional content and meaning of digital messages. However, researchers currently lack adequate tools to incorporate emojis into their analyses, missing critical opportunities to study the emotional functions of emojis. This article explores the psychological impact of emojis and their role in emotional expression in digital communication.

## What are Emojis?

Emojis are small digital images or icons used to express ideas or emotions. They originated from emoticons, which are typographic representations of facial expressions using characters like :) or :(. Emojis, however, provide a more visually detailed and diverse set of symbols. They range from smiley faces and hand gestures to objects, animals, and symbols. The Unicode Consortium standardizes emojis, ensuring they are recognized across different devices and platforms.

## History and Evolution of Emoji

**Origins: Smiley, Emoticons, and Early Emoji**

The journey of emoji began with the creation of the smiley face in the 1960s. This simple yellow face with two dots for eyes and a wide grin became a popular symbol of happiness and positivity. In the 1980s, emoticons were introduced, using combinations of standard punctuation marks to represent facial expressions, such as :-) for a smiling face or :-( for a frowning face. Emoticons added an element of emotional nuance to text-based communication.

**Creation of Emoji**

The first set of emoji was created in 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, a designer working for the Japanese mobile operator NTT DoCoMo. Kurita developed 176 12x12 pixel images to enhance the i-mode mobile platform's messaging features. These early emojis included a variety of expressions, objects, and symbols, providing users with a richer means of communication. The concept quickly caught on, and other Japanese mobile carriers began incorporating emojis into their services.

**Global Standardization**

In 2010, emojis were incorporated into the Unicode Standard, a significant development that enabled their consistent representation across different platforms and devices. This standardization allowed emojis to be universally recognized and used, facilitating their widespread adoption in instant messaging, email, social networking, and other forms of computer-mediated communication (CMC).

**Expansion and Popularity**

Since their inclusion in the Unicode Standard, the number of available emojis has grown exponentially. Unicode Consortium, the organization responsible for emoji standardization, regularly updates the emoji set to include new symbols, reflecting cultural trends, technological advancements, and social movements. Today, there are thousands of emojis, covering a wide array of expressions, objects, activities, and concepts.

**Impact on Digital Communication**

Emojis have transformed digital communication by providing a visual language that complements text. They offer a way to convey emotions, clarify intent, and add personality to messages, helping to bridge the gap created by the lack of non-verbal cues in text-based interactions. The use of emojis has become ubiquitous, with billions of emojis being sent daily across various digital platforms.

**Future Developments**

As digital communication continues to evolve, so too will the role of emojis. Future developments may include more diverse and inclusive emojis, advancements in emoji design, and new ways to integrate emojis into emerging communication technologies. The ongoing updates by the Unicode Consortium ensure that emojis remain relevant and reflective of contemporary society.

## Emojis and Emotional Expression

Emojis play a critical role in emotional communication online. They can convey subtle emotional cues such as irony, sarcasm, and playfulness that may be difficult to express through text alone. According to Bai et al. (2019), emojis facilitate communication of these cues, making digital interactions more nuanced and expressive.

### Usage and Functions of Emoji

**Emotional Expression**  
Emoji serve as non-verbal cues that enhance emotional expression in digital communication. They help convey emotions, clarify intentions, and manage interactions, filling the gap left by the absence of facial expressions, intonation, and gestures in text-based communication.

**Semantic Enhancement**  
Beyond emotions, emoji also convey semantic meanings. They act as visual metaphors and can supplement or replace text to enhance message clarity and impact. This dual function of emoji makes them a powerful tool in digital communication.

### The Role of Emojis in Enhancing Emotional Communication

Emojis enhance emotional communication by providing visual context to text-based messages. For example, a simple "I'm fine" can take on different emotional tones when paired with different emojis, such as a smiling face or a crying face. This additional layer of expression helps clarify the sender's emotional intent, reducing misunderstandings and enriching the overall communication experience.

### Emojis in Close Relationships

Research indicates that emojis are often used in communication between people in close relationships, helping maintain emotional closeness and understanding. Emojis can express affection, gratitude, and other positive emotions, reinforcing social bonds and fostering a sense of connection.

## Psychological Impact of Emojis

The psychological impact of emojis is significant, influencing how people perceive and respond to digital messages. Emojis can evoke emotional responses similar to those elicited by real-life facial expressions, as suggested by EEG studies (Gantiva et al., 2019). This ability to elicit emotional responses highlights the importance of emojis in digital communication.

### Emojis and Emotional Tone

Emojis help establish and adjust the emotional tone of a message. They can make messages appear more friendly, humorous, or serious, depending on the context. This capability is particularly useful in reducing ambiguity in text-based communication, where tone can be easily misinterpreted.

### The Multidimensional Lexicon of Emojis (MLE)

  1. **Emojis and Emotional Content**



To address the need for tools to analyze the emotional content of emojis, Rebecca Godard and Susan Holtzman developed the Multidimensional Lexicon of Emojis (MLE). The MLE consists of 359 common emojis rated on ten emotion and sentiment dimensions, including anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust, positivity, and negativity. This open-access tool enables comprehensive analysis of the emotional content of digital communication, incorporating emojis into sentiment analysis.

Their study used over three million Twitter posts and emotion ratings from 2,230 human raters to develop and validate the MLE. The study found that emojis play a significant role in conveying emotional content, with certain emojis consistently associated with specific emotions. For example, the "face with tears of joy" emoji was frequently used to express joy, while the "angry face" emoji was associated with anger.

  2. **Examples and Applications of MLE**



The study's results are presented in various tables that highlight the highest-scoring emojis on each emotion or sentiment. For instance, the "face with tears of joy" scored highest on joy, while the "angry face" scored high on anger. These findings illustrate the specific emotional associations of each emoji.

The lexicon also demonstrates its practical application by showing examples of tweets with high emotional content ratings, using both the NRC Emotion Lexicon and the MLE. This combined approach enhances the accuracy of sentiment analysis by including the emotional content conveyed by emojis.

The 359 emojis in the lexicon are presented in descending order of frequency in Supplementary Table 1. For brevity, the top 10 most frequently used emojis are listed here: face with tears of joy, loudly crying face, red heart, rolling on the floor laughing, pleading face, folded hands, smiling face with heart-eyes, fire, smiling face with hearts, and sparkles. These top emojis scored higher on positive sentiment and lower on negative sentiment, indicating their association with positivity, anticipation, joy, and trust.

(The top 10 emojis scored significantly higher on positive sentiment than negative sentiment, t(10.7) = 5.81, p < 0.001, d = 2.60. More specifically, scores on these emojis tended to be higher for positivity (0.61–1.47), anticipation (0.33–0.78), joy (0.30–0.88), and trust (0.38–0.98), and lower on anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and surprise (with scores consistently below 0.36).)

### Emojis in Relationship-Oriented Communication

Gesselman, Ta, and Garcia's study examined the role of emojis in relationship-oriented digital communication. The research found that using emojis can enhance emotional expression in computer-mediated communication (CMC), aiding in the development and maintenance of romantic and sexual relationships. The study, which included a large sample of single adults in the U.S., revealed that frequent use of emojis is associated with more first dates, increased sexual activity, and more successful intimate connections. This suggests that emojis serve as important affective signals, facilitating better emotional communication and connection in the digital age.

## Theories of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC)

Several theories within the field of CMC have explored the role of non-verbal cues in digital communication. One such theory is Social Information Processing (SIP), which argues that CMC users adapt to available cues to produce effective interpersonal communications. Emojis are an example of such cues, helping users convey and interpret emotional information in digital interactions.

### SIP and Emojis

SIP theory suggests that emojis compensate for the lack of non-verbal cues in text-based communication, allowing users to convey emotions and build social relationships effectively. Emojis can mimic facial expressions and gestures, providing visual context that enhances the clarity and emotional depth of messages.

### Non-Verbal Cues in Digital Communication

Non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions and body language, are essential for interpreting emotions in face-to-face interactions. In digital communication, emojis serve as substitutes for these non-verbal cues, helping convey emotions and intentions. This substitution is particularly valuable in maintaining emotional connections and understanding in online relationships.

## Applications of Emojis in Sentiment Analysis

Natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as sentiment analysis, can be enhanced by incorporating emojis. Sentiment analysis detects sentiment and emotion in language, with applications in marketing, social media analysis, and artificial intelligence. Traditional sentiment analysis primarily focuses on words, but including emojis provides a more comprehensive understanding of emotional content.

### Sentiment Analysis and Emojis

Several emoji lexicons have been developed for sentiment analysis, such as Novak et al.'s (2015) emoji lexicon, which classifies emojis as positive, negative, or neutral. The MLE builds on these efforts by offering a more detailed analysis of emojis across multiple emotional dimensions. This nuanced approach allows for more accurate and meaningful sentiment analysis.

### Case Studies

Case studies have shown that incorporating emojis into sentiment analysis improves the accuracy of emotional content detection. For example, analyzing tweets with and without emojis revealed that emojis significantly enhance the emotional clarity of messages. This improvement is particularly evident in detecting complex emotions like sarcasm and irony.

## Research Fields and Applications

**Computer Science**  
Research in computer science focuses on using emoji for sentiment analysis, modality transitions, and system optimization. Emoji-based sentiment analysis has proven effective across different languages, and algorithms have been developed to predict emoji usage based on textual content.

**Communication**  
Studies in communication examine how emoji compensate for the lack of non-verbal cues in CMC. Research explores individual differences, cultural influences, and platform-specific usage patterns, highlighting how emoji facilitate emotional and semantic expression.

Future studies could explore cultural differences in emoji use, the impact of new emojis, and the long-term effects of emoji use on communication and relationships.

### The Impact of New Emojis

The Unicode Consortium regularly updates the emoji set, adding new symbols and modifying existing ones. These updates reflect changing social norms and technological advancements. Future research should examine how new emojis are adopted and their impact on communication patterns and emotional expression.

**Emotional Association and Real Sentiments**  
Future research should focus on accurately measuring the emotional impact of emoji. This includes exploring the physiological responses of users and using qualitative methods to understand the context of emoji usage.

**User Preferences and Influencing Factors**  
Understanding the factors influencing user preferences for specific emoji can provide deeper insights into their usage. Research should explore the cultural, contextual, and personal factors that drive emoji preferences.

**Impact of Stickers on Emoji**  
The emergence of stickers presents a new dimension in digital communication. Researchers should investigate how stickers influence emoji usage and whether they will complement or replace emoji in certain contexts.

**Social and Political Implications**  
Emoji reflect cultural and political dynamics. Future research should explore the deeper social implications of emoji usage, including their role in cultural globalization, social inequality, and political movements.

### Cultural Differences in Emoji Use

Cultural factors significantly influence how emojis are used and interpreted. Different cultures may assign different meanings to the same emoji, affecting cross-cultural communication. Understanding these differences is crucial for developing global communication strategies and tools.

### Long-Term Effects of Emoji Use

While emojis have become an integral part of digital communication, their long-term effects on psychological well-being and social interactions are still not fully understood. Future studies should investigate how frequent emoji use influences emotional regulation, relationship satisfaction, and mental health.

## Takeaways

Emojis have transformed digital communication by adding a visual and emotional dimension to text-based messages. They play a crucial role in conveying emotions, enhancing message clarity, and maintaining social connections. The development of tools like the Multidimensional Lexicon of Emojis enables researchers to incorporate emojis into sentiment analysis, providing a more comprehensive understanding of emotional content in digital communication. As digital communication continues to evolve, ongoing research will be essential to fully understand the psychological impact of emojis and their role in shaping the future of online interactions.
