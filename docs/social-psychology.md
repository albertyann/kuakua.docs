# **Social Psychology**

Psychology, the study of the mind and behavior, recognizes that individual behavior is intricately linked to the social context in which people live. This perspective is central to social psychology, which investigates how our thoughts, feelings, and actions are shaped by the presence or influence of others. Dating back to the 18th century, social psychology has evolved significantly, with formal research emerging in the 1930s.

Social psychology delves into various aspects of human interaction, exploring personality, interpersonal relationships, and group dynamics. It seeks to understand how social situations impact mental states, and conversely, how individual psychological processes influence social behaviors. Ultimately, social psychologists explore the complex interplay between personal psychology and the social environment, shedding light on the factors that shape our social interactions and behaviors.

## History

In the 19th century, social psychology began to emerge as a distinct field within psychology, focusing on understanding the causes and effects of human social interactions through rigorous scientific inquiry. One of the earliest notable studies was Norman Triplett's 1898 experiment on social facilitation, which laid foundational groundwork for subsequent 20th century research in social psychology.

According to [Wolfgang Stroebe](/docs/psychologists/Wolfgang-Stroebe), modern social psychology began in 1924 with the publication of a classic textbook by [Floyd Henry Allport](/docs/psychologists/Floyd-Henry-Allport), which defined the field as the experimental study of social behavior.

During World War II, social psychologists played crucial roles in studying persuasion and propaganda, contributing significantly to military strategies. Post-war, the field expanded to address broader social issues including gender and racial prejudice.

Collaborations between psychologists and sociologists characterized the mid-20th century, although disciplines began to specialize independently. The 1960s witnessed increased interest in topics such as cognitive dissonance, bystander intervention, and aggression, utilizing more sophisticated experimental designs.

By the 1970s, social psychology faced conceptual challenges regarding ethical concerns in research, the predictive accuracy of attitudes, and the influence of cultural contexts on scientific inquiry. This period also saw the rise of situationism, challenging traditional notions of self and personality in psychological studies.

In response, the 1980s and 1990s saw advancements in theory and methodology within social psychology, addressing ethical standards and incorporating diverse cultural perspectives. In the 21st century, researchers continue to explore phenomena like attribution, social cognition, and self-concept, applying social psychology to practical domains such as health, education, law, and the workplace. Ethical standards now rigorously guide research practices, promoting pluralistic approaches that enrich the field's understanding of human behavior in diverse social contexts.

## Main concepts and theories

### [Conformity](/docs/social-psychology/conformity)

Conformity refers to the phenomenon where individuals adjust their beliefs or behaviors to align with those of a group. This adjustment can stem from real pressures of social interaction or perceived pressures based on social norms.

There are three distinct types of conformity:

  1. **[Internalization](/docs/social-psychology/internalization)** : This occurs when an individual genuinely accepts the beliefs or behaviors of the group as their own. Internalization often happens when individuals believe that the group is more knowledgeable or correct in their views.

  2. **[Identification](/docs/social-psychology/identification)** : In this form of conformity, individuals maintain their personal beliefs but adapt their behavior to align with the group's expectations. For instance, a police officer may enforce a law they personally disagree with due to professional obligation.

  3. **Ingratiational conformity** : This type involves conforming to gain acceptance or approval from others. It is driven by the desire to receive social rewards or avoid rejection from the group.




Each type of conformity plays a role in shaping how individuals navigate social interactions and integrate into groups, reflecting the complex interplay between personal beliefs and social pressures.

### [Obedience](/docs/social-psychology/obedience)

Obedience refers to the act of following commands or instructions from a person who holds authority and can influence others. Social psychologists studying obedience focus on understanding how individuals respond to perceived authority figures.

While obedience and conformity share similarities, the key distinction lies in the presence of a hierarchical structure involving direct commands. Authority figures, such as employers, teachers, doctors, or individuals seen as possessing superior knowledge or status, can exert influence over others' actions and decisions.

### [Self-Concept](/docs/social-psychology/self-concept)

Self-concept refers to your overall perception, thoughts, and evaluations of yourself. It includes an awareness that you exist within a societal framework with its own norms and expectations.

Self-concept encompasses several dimensions that interact to shape how you interact within broader social contexts:

Self-image: This aspect concerns how you perceive yourself-your physical appearance, abilities, and personal characteristics.

Self-esteem: This dimension involves the value you place on yourself and your worthiness. It reflects your overall sense of self-worth and confidence.

Ideal self: This pertains to the person you aspire to be, encompassing your goals, aspirations, and ideal characteristics.

Your self-concept plays a crucial role in determining your behavior and interactions with others. It influences how you perceive yourself relative to others and guides your decisions and actions in social situations.

### [Discrimination](/docs/social-psychology/discrimination)

Discrimination refers to behaviors and actions directed towards a group of people that are typically negative and are based on characteristics such as sex, race, class, or other traits.

It's important to distinguish ### [Discrimination](/docs/social-psychology/discrimination) from [prejudice](/docs/social-psychology/prejudice), as they are related but different concepts. Discrimination specifically refers to the actions taken against a group, while prejudice refers to the negative beliefs or attitudes held about a group, which may or may not result in discriminatory behavior.

### [Bystander Effect](/docs/social-psychology/bystander-effect)

The [bystander effect](/docs/social-psychology/bystander-effect), a theory in social psychology, suggests that individuals are less likely to offer help to a person in need when others are present. This phenomenon arises because individuals feel a diffusion of responsibility in a group setting, leading them to believe that someone else will take action.

However, the response to emergencies can be influenced by various factors. The specific nature of the situation, the individuals involved, and one's own capabilities all contribute to how someone reacts in such circumstances. These factors interact to shape whether and how quickly assistance is provided in times of need.

### [Attitudes](/docs/social-psychology/attitudes)

Attitudes in social psychology are learned evaluations that shape our thoughts and actions. They reflect our likes, dislikes, and broader approval or disapproval of various things, from chocolate ice cream to political ideologies. However, while attitudes provide a general framework for behavior, they may not always predict specific actions due to the influence of situational factors.

Cognitive dissonance theory, a significant 20th-century concept, posits that inconsistencies in attitudes can lead to psychological discomfort, prompting individuals to adjust their attitudes or behaviors to restore consistency.

Research has explored the distinction between explicit (self-reported) attitudes and implicit (unconscious) attitudes. Tools like the Implicit Association Test (IAT, by [Anthony Galt Greenwald](/docs/psychologists/Anthony-Galt-Greenwald)) reveal that people may harbor implicit biases, such as racial biases, even if their explicit attitudes suggest otherwise. This divergence can influence behaviors in social interactions, where explicit attitudes align with verbal responses while implicit attitudes manifest in nonverbal cues.

Attitudes play crucial roles across various domains within psychology, including conformity, interpersonal attraction, social perception, and prejudice. They serve as fundamental constructs that shape how individuals perceive and interact within their social environments.

### [Persuasion](/docs/social-psychology/persuasion)

Persuasion is the deliberate effort to influence people's attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors through logical or emotional appeals rather than coercion. This process is shaped by various factors categorized into five main groups:

  1. **Communication** : Includes factors like credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness of the communicator.

  2. **Message** : Involves the content of the persuasion attempt, such as the use of reason, emotional appeals (like fear), and the structure of arguments (one-sided or two-sided).

  3. **Audience** : Encompasses demographic characteristics, personality traits, and individual preferences of the audience targeted for persuasion.

  4. **Medium** : Refers to the channel through which the message is delivered, such as print, radio, television, internet, or face-to-face interactions.

  5. **Context** : Considers environmental factors, group dynamics, and existing information that may influence how persuasive messages are received.




Dual-process theories of persuasion, like the elaboration likelihood model, propose two routes through which persuasion occurs:

  * **Central Route** : Involves thoughtful consideration of arguments and facts, leading to more enduring attitude change. This route requires motivation and cognitive effort.

  * **Peripheral Route** : Relies on superficial cues such as attractiveness or source credibility rather than the content of the message. Changes through this route are typically less stable and require less cognitive processing.




These frameworks help explain how persuasion operates in diverse contexts, highlighting the interplay between message content, audience characteristics, and the communication environment.

### [Social Cognition](/docs/social-psychology/social-cognition)

Social cognition explores how individuals perceive, recognize, and remember information about others. A significant body of research posits that people process information differently when it involves other individuals compared to non-social or non-human targets. This distinction is underscored by observed social-cognitive deficits in conditions like Williams syndrome and autism. These conditions provide insights into how social cognition differs from other forms of cognitive processing.

### [Attribution](/docs/social-psychology/attribution)

A key focus within social cognition is attribution, which involves explaining behaviors, whether they are one's own or those of others.

Attribution involves two main dimensions: internal (dispositional) and external (situational) factors. Internal attribution attributes behavior to inner traits like personality or abilities, while external attribution attributes behavior to external circumstances such as the environment or situational factors. Additionally, attributions can consider whether the cause of behavior is stable or unstable (likely to persist or change over time) and controllable or uncontrollable (within the individual's control or not).

The attribution process is susceptible to various biases. For instance, the fundamental attribution error describes the tendency to overemphasize dispositional factors when explaining others' behavior. The actor-observer bias extends this idea, suggesting that individuals tend to attribute their own behavior to situational factors while attributing others' behavior to dispositional factors. Furthermore, the self-serving bias involves attributing successes to dispositional factors to boost self-esteem, while attributing failures to situational factors to protect self-esteem.

These biases in attribution illustrate how individuals interpret and explain behaviors, shaping their perceptions of themselves and others within social contexts.

### [Group Dynamics](/docs/social-psychology/group-dynamics)

Social psychologists investigate group-related phenomena, including crowd behavior. A group is defined as two or more individuals connected by social relationships. Unlike temporary gatherings (social aggregates), groups exhibit emergent qualities such as:

  * **Norms** : Implicit rules and expectations guiding member behavior.
  * **Roles** : Implicit rules governing specific group members.
  * **Relations** : Patterns of liking, status differences, and prestige within the group.



Shared social identity within groups influences intergroup behavior, shaping how groups perceive and interact with each other. This dynamic contributes to individuals' social identities within interacting groups.

Group membership can lead to intergroup discrimination, where favorable behaviors are directed towards the in-group and negative behaviors towards the out-group.

Groups often enhance decision-making and productivity. Social facilitation, for example, boosts effort and speed in the presence of others. Conversely, deindividuation-a state of reduced self-awareness-can lead to uninhibited and sometimes risky behaviors. Factors like anonymity (from disguise, uniform, alcohol, darkness, or online settings) contribute to deindividuation, which is often observed in crowds and online interactions.

### [Interpersonal Attraction](/docs/social-psychology/interpersonal-attraction)

Interpersonal attraction, a significant area of study in social psychology, encompasses the factors that lead people to like each other, form relationships, and sometimes develop romantic feelings. Social psychologists have identified several key principles of attraction, with similarity playing a crucial role. The more alike individuals are in attitudes, backgrounds, environments, worldviews, and other traits, the more likely they are to be drawn to each other.

Physical attractiveness also holds sway in early stages of romantic relationships, characterized by intense passion. As relationships progress, compatibility factors like similarity become increasingly important, transitioning love from passionate to companionate. [Robert Sternberg](/docs/psychologists/Robert-Sternberg)'s model of love in 1986 posited three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment, collectively known as consummate love when all three are present.

Social exchange theory posits that relationships are based on rational choices and cost-benefit analysis. Individuals may consider leaving a relationship if the costs (such as emotional or practical burdens) outweigh the benefits, especially if appealing alternatives exist. Over time, successful relationships often evolve beyond mere exchange dynamics to foster a more communal approach, emphasizing mutual support and shared goals over individual costs and rewards. This evolution reflects a shift from transactional to deeply interconnected partnerships.
