# **Understanding Psychoanalysis: Theory, Therapy, and Applications**

## Psychoanalysis

Psychoanalysis, established by the Austrian [Sigmund Freud](/docs/psychologists/Sigmund-Freud) in the late 19th century, refers to both a theory of how the mind operates and a therapeutic modality.  
This discipline emerged partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others.  
Psychoanalysis began with the well-known case of Miss Anna O., who insisted that her doctor, Viennese internist Josef Breuer, listen to what she had to say.  
In 1922, Freud defined this discipline across three dimensions: as a method of studying mental processes that are almost inaccessible by other means, a therapeutic approach based on such studies for treating neurotic disorders, and a body of psychological insights gained through these methods, gradually accumulating into a new scientific discipline.

Freud distinguished between the conscious and unconscious, asserting that the latter largely determines behavior and cognition due to unconscious drives.  
Freud observed that attempting to bring these drives into consciousness triggers resistance in the form of defense mechanisms, notably repression. Conflicts between conscious and unconscious material lead to mental disorders.  
Freud also posited that unconscious material can be found in dreams, slips of the tongue, and Freudian slips. Psychoanalytic therapy, or simply analysis, aims to improve mental health by bringing unconscious material into consciousness. Analysts place significant emphasis on early childhood development. During therapy, analysts aim to evoke transference, where patients re-experience infantile conflicts by projecting feelings of love, dependency, and anger onto the analyst.

Psychoanalysis assumes that thoughts or behaviors in the mind are not arbitrary but meaningful and can be discovered through exploring the unconscious. Thus, psychoanalysis has focused from its inception on symptoms of hysteria, dreams, jokes, slips of the tongue, and sexual desire as phenomena that reveal the unconscious. In an article, Freud identified the cornerstone of psychoanalysis as positing the existence of unconscious mental processes, acknowledging the theories of repression and resistance, and emphasizing the importance of sexuality and the Oedipus complex.

### Background

Psychoanalysis's founder Freud was a neurologist seeking effective treatments for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. His co-authored work with Josef Breuer, Studies on Hysteria (1895), is generally considered the birth of psychoanalysis.  
In the summer of 1897, Freud began self-analysis in letters to his close friend Wilhelm Fliess, discovering core psychoanalytic concepts like the Oedipus complex and infantile sexuality. Subsequently, Freud published The Interpretation of Dreams, Psychopathology of Everyday Life, and Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious. These writings on hysteria symptoms, dreams, slips of the tongue, and jokes marked the rise of this discipline.

### Development

Freud's colleagues [Alfred Adler](/docs/psychologists/Alfred-Adler) and [Carl Gustav Jung](/docs/psychologists/Carl-Jung) developed branches of psychoanalysis known respectively as Individual Psychology (Adler) and Analytical Psychology (Jung). Freud himself critiqued these developments extensively and vehemently denied them as forms of psychoanalysis. Later, neo-Freudian thinkers like [Erich Fromm](/docs/psychologists/Erich-Fromm), [Karen Horney](/docs/psychologists/Karen-Horney), and [Harry Stack Sullivan](/docs/psychologists/Harry-Stack-Sullivan) pushed psychoanalysis in different directions.

### Therapy

Freud's psychoanalytic theory created the framework for psychoanalytic therapy, a profound, personalized form of talk therapy. Psychoanalytic therapy includes an open dialogue aimed at uncovering long-buried ideas and memories in the unconscious mind. Psychoanalysts employ specific techniques such as free association, dream analysis, and transference analysis. Recognizing patterns in a client's speech and reactions can help individuals better understand their thoughts, behaviors, and relationships as a precursor to changing dysfunctional aspects.

Psychoanalysis therapy commonly addresses issues such as phobias, obsessions, compulsions, anxiety disorders, depression, sexual dysfunctions, relationship conflicts, and various personality issues. Initially treating patients, Freud engaged in conversation with his patients by listening to their stories and taking their memories seriously. Before him, neither Breuer nor Charcot treated hysteria patients this way.

Therefore, it can be said that psychoanalysis has always been a form of talk therapy from the beginning, and language is the "scalpel" and "surgical object" of psychoanalysis. This method of research and therapy prompted Freud to explore the unconscious psyche of humans and to formulate a series of analyst-centered clinical guidelines. Since the mid-20th century, the term "analysand" has replaced the terms "patient" and "analyzed person."

### Techniques

  * **Free association:** requiring the analyte to say anything that comes to mind during the analytical process. Apparently irrelevant, incomprehensible ideas are linked together by the analyst's explanation, eventually forming a concept representing unconscious content. Free association assumes that the mind is deterministic.

  * **Explanation:** especially the interpretation of dreams, is the "path to understanding the unconscious" in Freud's view.

  * **Focus on speech errors or Freudian errors:** during the treatment process, analysts may make verbal mistakes, and analysts or the analysts themselves assume that the unconscious is visible in them and try to understand their meaning.

  * **Analyzing everyday behaviors:** especially omissions, forgetfulness, and neglect, these behaviors reflect psychological conflicts between unconscious and preconscious-conscious, and the former disrupts or cuts off the latter's operation. Therefore, psychoanalysis assumes that there are unconscious psychological conflicts in the analytes, which are crucial in the analysis.




## Theoretical Content

### **Sexual impulse (Libido):**

It also known as desire, early transliteration is very powerful, it is a concept proposed by [Sigmund Freud](/docs/psychologists/Sigmund-Freud). It refers to the internal state of excitement of the body, is the source or strength of desire and motivation.

### **Death Drive:**

Death Drive (German: Todestrieb) is a force that leads to death and destruction, usually through aggression, compulsory repetition, and self-destruction. It was first proposed by Sabrina Schierlein in a 1912 paper, and was later proposed by Freud in 1920 in Beyond the Pleasure Principle.

### **Psychological structure:**

Freud's psychoanalytic theory divides human psychological structure into three parts: subconscious, pre-conscious, and consciousness. Consciousness is the psychological aspect that people perceive directly. The subconscious is the person's primitive impulse and instinctual desires, but these are repressed by social ethics and laws and cannot be directly perceived. Pre-consciousness is the subconscious that can be recalled and can be transformed into consciousness through intentional attention and effort. Freud used the principle of determinism in exploring human psychological fields, believing that things must happen because of it. Trivial things, such as dreams, slips of the tongue, and typos, all have latent reasons in the brain, but they are disguised in a form.

**Component**| **Description**| **Characteristics**  
---|---|---  
**Consciousness**|  This is the part of the mind that people are aware of at any given moment. It includes thoughts, perceptions, and everyday awareness of the environment and oneself.| Directly accessible and perceivable by the individual; contains immediate thoughts and perceptions.  
**Pre-consciousness**|  This includes thoughts, memories, and feelings that are not immediately in consciousness but can be easily recalled with some effort or attention.| Accessible with intentional focus; acts as a bridge between consciousness and the subconscious.  
**Subconscious**|  This is the deepest part of the psyche, containing primitive impulses, desires, and emotions that are repressed due to societal norms and laws.| Not directly accessible; includes repressed thoughts, instincts, and desires that influence behavior unconsciously.  
  
### **Personality structure:**

In psychodynamics, Freud believes that the spirit has three parts: ego, ego, and super-ego. "I" is completely subconscious and is not subject to subjective consciousness. Represents desire and is suppressed by consciousness. "Ego" is mostly conscious and is responsible for dealing with the real world. "Super-Ego" is partially conscious and is a good judgment or inner moral judgment.

**Component**| **Description**| **Characteristics**  
---|---|---  
**Id**|  The id is entirely unconscious and represents basic drives, desires, and instincts, including pleasure-seeking and immediate gratification. It operates on the pleasure principle.| Impulsive, seeks immediate satisfaction of desires, and ignores societal rules and consequences.  
**Ego**|  The ego is mostly conscious and mediates between the id and the real world. It operates on the reality principle, finding realistic ways to satisfy the id's desires.| Rational, problem-solving, and considers long-term consequences; balances the id's desires and the super-ego's moral constraints.  
**Super-Ego**|  The super-ego is partially conscious and represents internalized societal norms, morals, and ideals, acting as a self-critical conscience.| Acts as the moral compass, strives for perfection, and judges actions based on social and ethical standards.  
  
### **Sexual Psychological Development:**

This is a concept proposed by [Sigmund Freud](/docs/psychologists/Sigmund-Freud) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is the core of psychoanalytic sex drive theory. Psychological development includes five stages: oral phase, anal phase, genital phase, dormant phase, and reproductive phase.

**Stage**| **Description**| **Age Range**  
---|---|---  
**Oral Phase**|  In this stage, pleasure centers around the mouth, with activities like sucking, biting, and breastfeeding being key to the child’s satisfaction.| Birth to 18 months  
**Anal Phase**|  Pleasure focuses on controlling bladder and bowel movements. The child learns to deal with demands for control over bodily functions.| 18 months to 3 years old  
**Phallic (Genital) Phase**|  In this stage, the child’s focus is on the genital area, and they become aware of gender differences, leading to the Oedipus complex or Electra complex.| 3 to 6 years old  
**Latency (Dormant) Phase**|  Sexual impulses are repressed, and the focus is on social interactions, learning, and cognitive development.| 6 years old to puberty  
**Genital (Reproductive) Phase**|  This final stage involves mature sexual interests developing, with a focus on relationships and well-being beyond just individual pleasure.| Puberty to adulthood  
  
### **Defense mechanism:**

Defense mechanism is a strategy that people protect themselves from anxiety, thoughts, or feelings of harm in the unconscious.  
Psychiatrist [George Eman Vaillant](/docs/psychologists/George-Vaillant), based on his longitudinal Grant Study that began in 1937, introduced a four-level classification of defense mechanisms in 1977. This hierarchy categorizes defense mechanisms according to their adaptability and correlation with mental health, ranging from pathological to mature defenses.

#### Level I – Pathological Defenses

**Defense Mechanism**| **Description**| **Characteristics**| **Example**  
---|---|---|---  
**Psychotic Denial**|  Refusal to accept external reality because it is too threatening.| Individuals distort reality, acting as if threatening realities do not exist.| A person denying a terminal diagnosis, claiming the doctors are wrong.  
**Delusional Projection**|  Delusions about external reality, usually of a persecutory nature.| Extreme paranoia or delusions that others are conspiring against the individual.| Someone believing that neighbors are spying on them without any evidence.  
**Distortion**|  Gross reshaping of external reality to meet internal needs.| Severe alteration of facts or experiences to fit one's desires or expectations.| A person believing they are a celebrity even though they are not.  
  
#### Level II – Immature Defenses

**Defense Mechanism**| **Description**| **Characteristics**| **Example**  
---|---|---|---  
**Acting Out**|  Expressing unconscious wishes or impulses through actions rather than words.| Impulsive actions driven by unconscious desires, often disruptive.| A teenager breaking things when they are angry.  
**Hypochondriasis**|  Excessive worry about having a serious illness.| Preoccupation with physical symptoms without medical basis.| Constantly visiting doctors despite being told they are healthy.  
**Passive-Aggressive Behavior**|  Indirect expression of hostility, often through procrastination or stubbornness.| Hostility is masked by passive behaviors that indirectly express dissatisfaction.| A worker repeatedly missing deadlines without explaining why.  
**Projection**|  Attributing one’s own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to others.| Individuals perceive their own flaws in others, avoiding conscious awareness of their own issues.| Accusing someone else of being angry when you are actually angry.  
**Schizoid Fantasy**|  Retreating into daydreams or fantasies to escape from reality or emotional conflicts.| Disconnection from reality through vivid daydreaming as a way to avoid emotional stress.| A person constantly daydreaming about an ideal life instead of addressing their real-life problems.  
**Splitting**|  Dividing people or things into all good or all bad categories without room for complexity or nuance.| Perception of the world in extremes, leading to difficulties in relationships and decision-making.| Seeing someone as a perfect friend one day and as a terrible enemy the next.  
  
#### Level III – Neurotic Defenses

**Defense Mechanism**| **Description**| **Characteristics**| **Example**  
---|---|---|---  
**Displacement**|  Redirecting emotions from a threatening object to a safer one.| Emotions are transferred to less threatening targets to avoid confronting the original source.| Yelling at a family member after having a bad day at work.

**Repression**|  Pushing distressing thoughts or memories into the unconscious to avoid dealing with them.| Unpleasant emotions or desires are kept out of conscious awareness.| A person forgetting a traumatic experience from childhood.  
  
#### Level IV – Mature Defenses
