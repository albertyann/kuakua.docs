# **Humanistic psychology**

Humanistic psychology is a psychological trend and reform movement that emerged in mid-20th century America, opposing the mechanistic environmental determinism of behaviorism and the instinctual biological reductionism of psychoanalysis. It emphasizes the exploration of human nature, potential, dignity, and values. Building upon critiques of and inheritance from behaviorism and psychoanalysis, it has developed its own theoretical framework, often referred to as the "third force" in psychology.

## Origins

Before humanistic psychology emerged, there existed a group of psychologists in Europe whose views closely aligned with existentialist philosophers, leading them to be labeled as existentialist psychologists. These psychologists included [Ludwig Binswanger](/docs/psychologists/Ludwig-Binswanger), [Viktor Frankl](/docs/psychologists/Viktor-Frankl), and [Rollo May](/docs/psychologists/Rollo-May) among others. The focus of existential psychotherapy is to address existential crises and existential anxiety, which are feelings of panic and fear that arise in individuals due to the perceived meaninglessness of life. Existential therapy typically involves emphasizing freedom of choice and establishing a lifestyle that alleviates emptiness, anxiety, and distress, fostering a more mature attitude toward life.  
Existentialist philosophy profoundly influenced the perspectives of some American psychologists of the time. Carl Rogers was one such individual. However, Rogers gradually realized that early attempts to use existentialism in therapy did not help patients determine their problems or how to solve them. Another influenced figure, Abraham Maslow, stated, "We need a scientific psychology more convincing than existentialism to think about those problems traditionally solved by non-scientistsâ€”religion, poetry, values, philosophy, and art." Establishing a new school of psychology to understand human behavior became the lifelong work of Rogers and Maslow, forming the nascent stage of humanistic psychology.  
Furthermore, after World War II, the economic prosperity and improved living standards in the United States satisfied people's basic needs while also prompting them to pursue higher spiritual needs. Simultaneously, Western capitalist societies faced significant social issues and spiritual crises that traditional Freudian psychoanalysis could no longer adequately explain modern psychological illnesses. There was an urgent need for a new psychological theory to address these issues. Thus, humanistic psychology emerged.

## Postulates of Humanistic Psychology

There are three main postulates of this branch of humanistic psychology:  
People possess inherent goodness and the capacity for personal growth.  
The environment influences whether personal growth is hindered or supported.  
People are driven by a need for self-actualization, aspiring to achieve their fullest potential.

## Representative Personage

[Carl Rogers](/docs/psychologists/Carl-Rogers) is one of the key figures in humanistic psychology, known for his practice and research in psychological counseling and therapy. He pioneered non-directive therapy and introduced the client-centered approach to psychotherapy, emphasizing individuals' capacity for self-adjustment to restore psychological health. Rogers believed that therapists achieve maximum effectiveness through three key qualities: genuineness, empathy, and unconditional positive regard. He advocated for therapists to accept their clients without judgment, regardless of their actions or identities. Rogers profoundly influenced the interaction between therapists and clients. He also dedicated himself to advancing humanistic psychology, bringing profound changes to the field with his unique perspectives and methodology. Additionally, Rogers played a crucial role in promoting group therapy methods and integrating insights from his therapeutic work into general personality theory.

[Abraham Maslow](/docs/psychologists/Abraham-Maslow), a renowned American social psychologist and the founder of the "third force" in psychology, integrated elements of psychoanalysis and behaviorism into humanistic psychology. He also incorporated aesthetic thought into his theories. His major achievements include the formulation of humanistic psychology and Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, both of which have had a profound impact on subsequent psychological research.

Abraham Maslow laid a solid foundation for humanistic psychology through his theoretical framework and hierarchy of needs theory, while Carl Rogers advanced the practical application and development of humanistic psychology with his pioneering therapeutic methods and contributions to psychological counseling.

## basic view

Humanistic psychologists emphasize the study of human values and personality development in psychology. They oppose Freudian psychoanalysis, which reduces conscious experiences to basic drives or defense mechanisms, and reject the view that consciousness is merely a byproduct of behavior. Regarding the issue of human values, humanistic psychologists largely agree with the idealistic views of Plato and Rousseau, asserting that human nature is inherently good and that evil is a derivative phenomenon influenced by the environment. Therefore, they believe that through education, humans can improve, and an ideal society is achievable. In terms of fundamental theories and methodologies in psychology, they inherit the traditions of W. Dilthey and M. Wertheimer from the late 19th century, advocating for a respectful treatment of the uniqueness of psychological research subjects. They oppose the application of principles and methods from atomic physics and animal psychology to the study of human psychology, advocating for holism over reductionism.  
Some key points are as follows:

### 1 Human responsibility

People are ultimately responsible for what happens to them, which forms the foundation of humanistic personality theory. This explains why we often say "I have to," such as "I have to go to work," "I have to take a shower," or "I have to follow my boss's orders." In reality, we don't necessarily have to do these things. We can even choose to do nothing. At specific moments, behavior is simply each person's own choice. Freud and behaviorism portray people as unable to control themselves, but humanistic psychologists view individuals as active architects of their own lives, capable of freely changing themselves. Any inability to change is merely due to physical limitations. The primary goal of humanistic psychotherapy is to help clients recognize their ability to do what they want to do.

### 2 Live in the present moment

Many people in life often indulge in nostalgia or find themselves unable to let go of the past, reminiscing about happier times or repeatedly reliving embarrassing encounters or painful breakups. Others are constantly planning for the future, disregarding the present moment. From the perspective of humanistic psychologists, dwelling on nostalgia or daydreaming every day consumes valuable time that could be spent breathing fresh air, enjoying sunsets, or engaging in more meaningful activities. Humanistic psychologists would tell you, "Today is the first day of the rest of your life."According to humanistic views, only by living in accordance with life's true essence can we become fully functioning person. It is only by living in the here and now that people can fully enjoy life.

### 3 Phenomenology of the individual

Humanistic psychology holds that no one knows oneself better than you do. It believes individuals are capable of overcoming temporary difficulties on their own. Humanistic therapists encourage clients to overcome difficulties on their own and continue to grow.

### 4 Personal growth

According to humanistic psychology, satisfying all immediate needs is not the entirety of life. Even when all immediate needs are met, people may not feel satisfied or happy. True satisfaction and happiness come from continuously striving for personal growth, which is the pursuit of "self-actualization." Humanistic psychology believes that unless obstacles impede us, we naturally strive towards this state of fulfillment.
