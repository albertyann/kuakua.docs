# Cognitive Biases Codex

"Every single person, including myself, has many implicit associations that lead to bias that they can't fully eradicate in themselves. It's more effective to accept that fact and be transparent about it than to try to hide it."  
~Buster Benson, author of "Why Are We Yelling?"

Buster Benson did an impressive job categorizing cognitive biases, creating a massive Codex. Thinking is hard because of four universal conundrums.

## 1st Conundrum: Too Much Information

Thereâ€™s too much information in the universe for any individual to process it all. We filter most of it out, focusing only on what seems useful.

## 2nd Conundrum: Not Enough Meaning

Turning raw information into something meaningful requires connecting limited information to existing mental models, beliefs, and experiences.

## 3rd Conundrum: Not Enough Time & Resources

There isnâ€™t enough time to thoroughly analyze all possibilities. We make decisions quickly, often based on intuition rather than complete analysis.

## 4th Conundrum: Not Enough Memory

Our brains canâ€™t store all information, symbols, and past decisions. We strategically choose what to remember, often generalizing to save space.

## Addressing the Four Problems with Cognitive Biases

### Problem 1: Too Much Information

We use biases to filter information, focusing on what is already familiar or frequently repeated.

**Examples:**

  * Availability heuristic
  * Attentional bias
  * Illusory truth effect



### Problem 2: Not Enough Meaning

We connect the dots and fill gaps using existing knowledge, often leading to stories that aren't entirely accurate.

**Examples:**

  * Confabulation
  * Clustering illusion
  * Stereotyping



### Problem 3: Need to Act Fast

We make quick decisions based on confidence in our abilities, often leading to overconfidence.

**Examples:**

  * Overconfidence effect
  * Egocentric bias
  * Optimism bias



### Problem 4: What to Remember

We remember what seems most useful, often generalizing and simplifying information.

**Examples:**

  * Misattribution of memory
  * Implicit associations
  * Peakâ€“end rule



## The Downsides of Cognitive Biases

  1. **Filtered Information:** We may miss important information.
  2. **Illusions:** Our search for meaning can create inaccurate stories.
  3. **Flawed Decisions:** Quick decisions can be biased and counterproductive.
  4. **Reinforced Errors:** Our memories can reinforce these biases, worsening their impact.



## Takeaways

Cognitive biases are tools that help us manage information, make decisions, and remember important details. While they have downsides, understanding and acknowledging these biases can help us improve our thinking and decision-making processes. Recognizing our biases leads to better self-understanding and more informed actions.
